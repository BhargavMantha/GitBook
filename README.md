# What, Where and How to proceed

#### Step 1: Foundations

**Mathematics**

Understanding the basics of mathematics, especially discrete math, will help you with algorithmic thinking.

* Topics to Learn: Logic, Set Theory, Functions, Matrices, Probability, and Graph Theory
* Resources: [Khan Academy’s Discrete Math Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science), books like “Discrete Mathematics and its Applications” by Kenneth H. Rosen.

**Programming Language**

Choose a programming language you are comfortable with, as this will be the tool to implement what you learn.

* Suggested Languages: C++, Java, Python
* Resources: Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp, edX, or any language-specific tutorial depending on your choice.

#### Step 2: Basic Data Structures

Learn and practice implementing basic data structures.

**Arrays and Strings**

* Resources: [GeeksforGeeks Arrays Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/array-data-structure/)

**Linked Lists**

* Resources: [Coursera Linked List Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)

**Stacks and Queues**

* Resources: [GeeksforGeeks Stacks and Queues Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure/)

**Trees and Graphs**

* Resources: [UCSD Coursera Course on Basic Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures)

#### Step 3: Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Understand basic sorting and searching techniques.

* Topics to Learn: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search.
* Resources: [Khan Academy’s Algorithms Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)

#### Step 4: Intermediate Data Structures

**Hashing**

* Resources: [Introduction to Hashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hashing-data-structure/)

**Heaps**

* Resources: [Heap Data Structure Guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-data-structure/)

#### Step 5: Advanced Algorithms

**Graph Algorithms**

* Resources: [Graph Algorithms Course by UCSD on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-on-graphs)

**Dynamic Programming**

* Resources: [Dynamic Programming Guide on GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/)

**Greedy Algorithms**

* Resources: [Introduction to Greedy Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms/)

#### Step 6: Problem Solving and Practice

* Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank, CodeSignal.
* Resources: Books like “Cracking the Coding Interview” by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

#### Step 7: Special Topics

* Machine Learning Algorithms: If you have an interest in AI/ML.
* Network Flow Algorithms: If you are interested in network design and optimization.

#### Step 8: Projects

Building projects using the data structures and algorithms you’ve learned.

#### Step 9: Stay Updated and Engage with Community

* Read research papers, blog posts, engage with communities like Stack Overflow, Reddit.

#### Conclusion

Remember, mastering data structures and algorithms is a gradual process and requires consistent practice. Stick to the plan, and don’t hesitate to seek help from communities or mentors if you’re stuck. You can also consider joining a structured course from platforms like Coursera, Udacity, or edX to have a guided learning experience. Happy learning!

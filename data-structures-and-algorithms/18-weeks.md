  * Mock interviews (can use platforms like Pramp).
  * Solve interview-specific problems.
  * Review key concepts.

#### Additional Tips:

* **Review Regularly:** Spend some time each week to review what you've learned.
* **Adapt:** If a topic needs more time, adjust your schedule accordingly.
* **Peer Learning:** Consider finding a study partner or joining a study group.
* **Resources:** Utilize online resources like Coursera, Udemy, YouTube tutorials, and books like "Cracking the Coding Interview".

This roadmap is designed to progress from basics to more advanced topics over the course of approximately 18 weeks. The key is consistent, focused study and practice. Remember, it's okay to move slower if you need more time to understand certain concepts. The goal is to build a solid foundation in DSA, not to rush through the topics.
